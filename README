This is a base for a C++ trading application which uses C++ IB TWS API
forked from Ruediger Meier's repositorium [https://github.com/rudimeier/twsapi],
QuantLib-1.2.1 and CUDA 5.0.
This trading client application is compiled on Ubuntu 12.10 with g++ 4.7
and now it is constantly developed.

Changes of original IB API included by use of Ruediger Meier's version of API
--------------------------


Improvements:
 - Comfortable autotools build chain and pkg-config support to make developers
   happy.
 - Generally the socket error handling is stable and reliable now. Error message
   callbacks with code SOCKET_EXCEPTION are using standard message strings
   (errno/strerror).
 - Never throwing nor catching any Exceptions.
 - Using non-blocking sockets with well defined connection timeout. 
 - Hostnames will be resolved.
 - IPv6 support.
 - Source compatibility between API updates.


Below some details about the improved reliablity of the API interface functions
and callbacks.

eConnect():
 1. It's blocking and returns either connected or disconnected.
 2. It may callback informative error messages only. No more checking of
    regular messages.
 3. If any callback is fired then state will still be  "disconnected".
    Return false in this case. There are no "positive callbacks".
 4. There can be multiple callbacks, for example "UPDATE_TWS" and then
    "CONNECT_FAIL" but 2. and 3. are always in place! The client programmer
    does not need to do any cleanup actions on these callbacks.
 5. Before returning false CONNECT_FAIL with descriptive message will be fired
    fore sure.


onReceive():
 1. Any callback (except connectionClosed()) will be fired in state connected,
    even if we are going to be disconnected.
 2. Before connectionClosed() is fired we will get a "SOCKET_EXCEPTION"
    callback still in state conneted.


all other req*() functions:
 1. If called while disconneted then it sends a NOT_CONNECTED callback (we
    could have known before).
 2. On error it sends a SOCKET_EXCEPTION (still in state connected) and
    then connectionClosed() (already disconnected state).
 3. Another possible callback is UPDATE_TWS (does not disconnect us).



Thus we know about callbacks:
 1. Within connectionClosed() we are disconnected for sure.
 2. Within error() we could be disconneted only if code is CONNECT_FAIL,
    UPDATE_TWS or NOT_CONNECTED.
 3. In any other case callbacks will be received in state connected.


TODO: In oppsite to the statements above SOCKET_EXCEPTION may still be fired in
      state connected if onReceive() or onSend() are called while disconnected
      (we could have known before). To be safe we could return early and send
      NOT_CONNECTED.


API internal implementation notes:

bufferedRead()
 1. Behaves like ::recv() regarding errno and return value:
      -1: error, errno set
       0: EOF, disconnectd
      >0: success
